# Book Recommendation System using Flask

This project implements a book recommendation system using Flask, incorporating both popularity-based and collaborative filtering approaches. Let's delve into the implementation details:
Implementation Details

Setup

Dependencies: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Install required dependencies using pip:


    pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Dataset: You'll need a dataset containing information about books, ratings given by users, and user data. The dataset should include CSV files named Books.csv, Ratings.csv, and Users.csv. Additionally, ensure you have image URLs for book covers.

Running the Application: Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Run the Flask application:

bash

    python app.py

    
Accessing the Application: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the home page of the application. From there, you can explore popular books and receive recommendations.

### Features

    
Home Page: The home page displays a list of popular books, including their titles, authors, covers, number of ratings, and average ratings.
    
Recommendation Page: Users can input a book title they like, and the system will recommend similar books based on popularity or user ratings.

### File Structure

    app.py: Flask application script containing routes and main logic.
    templates/: Directory containing HTML templates for the user interface.
        index.html: Template for the home page displaying popular books.
        recommend.html: Template for displaying recommended books.
    data/: Directory containing dataset CSV files and image URLs.
    README.md: Documentation file explaining the project setup and usage.

## Data Preprocessing

    Reading Data: The system reads three CSV files containing book, rating, and user data using pandas' read_csv function. These files include information such as book titles, authors, publication years, user IDs, and book ratings.

    Data Cleaning:
        The system handles missing or invalid values in the dataset, ensuring data consistency.
        It converts relevant columns to appropriate data types, such as converting 'Year-Of-Publication' to integers.
        Duplicate book titles may exist in the dataset, so the system removes duplicates to maintain data integrity.

## Popularity-Based Recommendation

    Identifying Popular Books:
        The system calculates the number of ratings and average ratings for each book.
        Based on these metrics, it identifies popular books with a substantial number of ratings and high average ratings, indicating their popularity among users.

    Displaying Popular Books:
        The home page of the application displays a list of these popular books, along with their details such as title, author, cover image, number of ratings, and average rating.

## Collaborative Filtering

    User Selection:
        The system identifies "educated" users who have rated a significant number of books. These users are likely to provide reliable ratings for recommendations.

    Book Selection:
        It selects books that have received a sufficient number of ratings from these "educated" users. Books with fewer ratings may not provide accurate recommendations.
        The system filters out books that have not received enough ratings from the selected group of users.

    Generating Recommendations:
        Collaborative filtering generates recommendations based on similarities between users' rating patterns.
        It creates a pivot table where rows represent books, columns represent users, and values represent book ratings given by users.
        The system calculates similarity scores between books based on user ratings using cosine similarity.
        Recommendations are then generated by selecting books with the highest similarity scores to the user's preferences.

## Exporting Final Model

    Model Persistence:
        Once the recommendation system is trained and configured, the final model components such as the popularity-based DataFrame, collaborative filtering pivot table, and similarity scores are serialized using pickle.
        This ensures that the trained model can be reused without the need for retraining every time the application is restarted.

## Conclusion

This implementation combines popularity-based and collaborative filtering techniques to provide diverse and accurate book recommendations to users. By leveraging both approaches, the system offers recommendations based on both the general popularity of books and individual user preferences, enhancing the user experience. The final model, stored in pickle format, can be easily loaded and deployed within the Flask application to provide real-time recommendations to users.
